# Instructions
There are two parts to this assignment. Write the code for Part 1 in `part1.cpp` and the code for Part 2 in `part2.cpp`. Select these files from the Explorer view on the left.

**Note**: All sides are not necessarily same the length. 

**Note**: All sides are integers.

**Note**: You are **allowed** to use the book, your notes, and online sources.

**Note**: You are **not allowed** to use code generation tools, AI tools, or question-and-answer sources.
      This will result in an automatic zero, and steps further outlined in the syllabus.

# Part 1
Without using classes, write a program to calculate the perimeter of shapes. 
The program must accept from user input the number of sides the shape has, 
and the length of each side, then calculate the perimeter, and display the result.

# Part 2
Using classes, write the same program from Part 1. Create a Shape class that stores 
the number of sides a shape has, the length of each side, and a method that calculates 
the perimeter and returns it. The class must not print any value to the screen or prompt 
the user to enter any value. All user input and output to the screen must be done in the 
main function.

# Sample Output

## Execution 1
```
Enter the number of sides the shape has: 2
Enter length: 3
Enter length: 4
Perimeter: 7
```
## Execution 2
```
Enter the number of sides the shape has: 5
Enter length: 2
Enter length: 6
Enter length: 9
Enter length: 8
Enter length: 7
Perimeter: 32
