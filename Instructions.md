# Instructions
There are two parts to this assignment. Write the code for Part 1 in `part1.cpp` and the code for Part 2 in `part2.cpp`. Select these files from the Explorer view on the left.

Note: All sides are not necessarily same the length.

Note: All sides are integers.

Note: You are **allowed** to use the book, your notes, and online sources.

Note: You are **not allowed** to use code generation tools, AI tools, or question and answer sources. This will result in automatic zero and steps further outlined in the syllabus. 

# Part 1
Without using classes, write a program to calculate the perimeter 
of shapes. The program must accept from user input the number of sides
the shape from the user and the length of each side, then calculate the 
perimeter, and display the result. 

# Part 2
Using classes, write the same program from Part 1. 
Create a Shape class which stores the number of sides a shape has, 
the length of each side, and a method that calculates the perimeter 
and returns it. The class must not print any value to the screen or 
prompt the user to enter any value. All user input and output to 
screen must be done in the main function.
