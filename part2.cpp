/*
Using classes, write the same program from Part 1. 
Create a Shape class which stores the number of sides a shape has, 
the length of each side, and a method that calculates the perimeter 
and returns it. The class must not print any value to the screen or 
prompt the user to enter any value. All user input and output to 
screen must be done in the main function.

Note: All sides are not necessarily same the length.
Note: All sides are integers.
